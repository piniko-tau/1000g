- print "patients",print diagnosis, print gene list order by gene

query for header : 

pydb=> select gene_name, string_agg(rsid,',' order by rsid) as rsids from (select distinct gene_name,rsid from mind_data_1_rs_ensorted_by_gene_posann )as t1 group by t1.gene_name order by t1.gene_name;

two columns :- select gene_name from header table
		- select rsids from header table


for patient : 

print patient id, print diagnosis, then : 

select !!!string_agg(al to peptide)!!! + select gene_name, string_agg(!!! maybe drop ? !!! rsid,',' order by rsid) as rsids from (select distinct gene_name,rsid from mind_data_1_rs_ensorted_by_gene_posann )as t1 group by t1.gene_name order by t1.gene_name;
